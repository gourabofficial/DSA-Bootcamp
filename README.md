# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

# Start Date: 10th September 2024

This repository contains my implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. The goal is to enhance my understanding of fundamental algorithms and problem-solving techniques in computer science.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for different algorithms and data structures.
- **test/**: Contains unit tests for the implementations.
  
## Contents

### 1. Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- Graphs

### 2. Algorithms
- Searching
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
- Sorting
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
  - BFS (Breadth-First Search)
  - DFS (Depth-First Search)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Getting Started
